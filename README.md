This C++ code determines whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. Â  

Key Features:

Converts to Lowercase: Converts all characters in the string to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparisons.
Removes Non-alphanumeric Characters: Removes non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) to focus on the core word or phrase.
Efficient Palindrome Check: Uses an efficient algorithm that iterates ony up to half the string's length, comparing characters from both ends.
Usage:

Enter a string when prompted.
The code will output whether the string is a palindrome or not.

Example:

Enter a string: racecar
"racecar" is a palindrome.
This code provides a reliable and efficient solution for palindrome detection in C++.
